## What am I trying to do? 

I'm trying to solve the standard 3x3x3 Rubik's in 4 grades of difficulty using deep reinforcement learning: 
1. Grade-1: Purely representational I/O
2. Grade-2: Representiational input + Assisted articulation
3. Grade-3: Representational input + Embodied articulation
4. Grade-4: Fully embodied perception + articulation
